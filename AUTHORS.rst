Overview
=========
Buried water pipelines experience severe damages during earthquake loading. Aging and deteriorated water pipelines are highly vulnerable to earthquakes. Improved asset management can be ensured by accurately determining the seismic loss in the water system. The repair rate of the buried pipeline is typically estimated based on the empirical equation. This tool performs scenario-based seismic damage of water pipelines.
