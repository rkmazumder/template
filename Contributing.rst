Corrosion Models
================

A number of corrosion models exist in the literature that estimate the expected depth of corrosion pit over time. Among these models, the model proposed by Rajani et al. (2000) and that proposed Petersen and Melchers (2012) were developed based on field investigation of corrosion dataset of CI pipelines, and therefore, both are applicable for CI pipes.
