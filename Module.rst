Roughness Model
===============

The roughness of pipelines increases with the increase in internal corrosion over time, which leads to a decrease in the roughness coefficient, C (Sharp and Walski 1988). Roughness coefficient depends on water quality, initial roughness, and pipe diameter (Sharp and Walski 1988).
